# TrIvent

This is a travel web application called TrIvent, and the primary purpose is to search for events happening in a particular city. 

Once the event results populate, the user can check the weather for that day (if applicable) and purchase tickets for the event.

This is built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScipt/jQuery, and utilizes the TicketMaster and Darksky weather APIs, along with Firebase's Realtime Database.
